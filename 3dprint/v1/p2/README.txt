# Summary

This is the second file publish of my robotic arm series. This component is the turntable of the robotic arm.

The following hardware will be needed to assemble the gripper:
- M3 x 10mm round head(25x)
- M3 x 8mm round head (8x)
- M3 x 3mm grub screw (1x)
- M4 x 3mm grub screw (1x)
- M4 x ...mm (5x), length for bottom plate bolts will depend on your wooden base plate thickness.
- 10mm x 30mm x 9mm bearing, 6200zz (2x)
- 10mm steel balls (10x)

The following electronic parts will be needed:
- Nema 17 (34mm height) stepper motor
- BOURNS 3590S 10 turn potentiometer

The assembly should be pretty straight forward, just follow the exploded view. Questions?? Message me!

Notes:
- Print the bearing clamp twice!
- All critical holes are oversized by 0.25mm to guarantee an easy fit.
- All the M3 / M4 holes are sized 2.8mm / 3.8mm in diameter. Apply some grease (not necessary, but it makes it easier) on a normal bolt and screw them in the parts with some proper tools. This should make some neat and tight threads in the plastic.
- While assembling, make sure the potentiometer is rotated to the center (5 turns). Next align the notch of the rotating plate with the potentiometer and push the rotating plate in place.
- Apply some light oil or grease on the 10mm steel balls.

# Post-Printing

## Base top and rotating plate ball guide

Both the circular ball guide from the base top plate and the rotating plate can be sanded with some fine sandpaper to improve the rotational capabilities of the turntable.
